# ttskit

An unofficial command line toolkit (and MCP server) for developing
[Tabletop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/)
mods. Not affiliated with or endorsed by Berserk Games.

> **Status:** early development. Nothing is usable yet; see the issue tracker
> for the roadmap.

## Planned features

- **Save pack/unpack:** split a save into readable, diff-friendly files and
  assemble it again, byte-exact, with `require` / `<Include/>` bundling.
- **Steam Cloud management:** one cloud folder per game, sync with a local
  directory, a committed manifest of asset URLs, and a scan of the asset URLs
  a save uses.
- **External Editor API client:** talk to a running game to read and write
  scripts, run Lua and capture console output.
- **MCP server:** expose the editor API to AI assistants.

## Building
